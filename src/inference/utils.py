    One padder to pad them all. Documentation? Well okay. A little bit

    Padding is done such that the original content will be at the center of the padded image. If the amount of padding
    needed it odd, the padding 'above' the content is larger,
    Example:
    old shape: [ 3 34 55  3]
    new_shape: [3, 34, 96, 64]
    amount of padding (low, high for each axis): [[0, 0], [0, 0], [20, 21], [30, 31]]

    :param image: can either be a numpy array or a torch.Tensor. pad_nd_image uses np.pad for the former and
           torch.nn.functional.pad for the latter
    :param new_shape: what shape do you want? new_shape does not have to have the same dimensionality as image. If
           len(new_shape) < len(image.shape) then the last axes of image will be padded. If new_shape < image.shape in
           any of the axes then we will not pad that axis, but also not crop! (interpret new_shape as new_min_shape)

           Example:
           image.shape = (10, 1, 512, 512); new_shape = (768, 768) -> result: (10, 1, 768, 768). Cool, huh?
           image.shape = (10, 1, 512, 512); new_shape = (364, 768) -> result: (10, 1, 512, 768).

    :param mode: will be passed to either np.pad or torch.nn.functional.pad depending on what the image is. Read the
           respective documentation!
    :param return_slicer: if True then this function will also return a tuple of python slice objects that you can use
           to crop back to the original image (reverse padding)
    :param shape_must_be_divisible_by: for network prediction. After applying new_shape, make sure the new shape is
           divisibly by that number (can also be a list with an entry for each axis). Whatever is missing to match
           that will be padded (so the result may be larger than new_shape if shape_must_be_divisible_by is not None)
    :param kwargs: see np.pad for documentation (numpy) or torch.nn.functional.pad (torch)

    :returns: if return_slicer=False, this function returns the padded numpy array / torch Tensor. If
              return_slicer=True it will also return a tuple of slice objects that you can use to revert the padding:
              output, slicer = pad_nd_image(input_array, new_shape=XXX, return_slicer=True)
              reversed_padding = output[slicer] ## this is now the same as input_array, padding was reversed
